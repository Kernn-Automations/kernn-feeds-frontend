## Component Architecture

### TargetReports (Main Component)
- Manages overall state and data flow
- Handles API calls through the service layer
- Coordinates between filters and table components
- Manages loading states and error handling

### TargetReportsFilters
- Handles all filter inputs and validation
- Loads role options from API
- Provides form submission and reset functionality
- Validates date ranges

### TargetReportsTable
- Displays reports data in a responsive table
- Includes export buttons and summary statistics
- Handles empty states and loading indicators
- Provides progress visualization

### TargetReportsService
- Centralized API communication layer
- Handles all Target Reports endpoints
- Provides utility functions for formatting
- Manages blob downloads for exports

## Authentication
All endpoints require JWT token in Authorization header, which is automatically handled by the `axiosAPI` instance from the Auth context.

## Error Handling
- Network error handling with user-friendly messages

- Form validation for date ranges
- Loading state management during API calls

## Styling
- Custom CSS module with responsive design
- Bootstrap integration for consistent UI
- Animated transitions and hover effects

## Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing Reports routing system
- Uses existing Auth context for API authentication
- Follows established patterns from other report components
- Compatible with existing UI components and styling

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all filter combinations
2. Verify PDF and Excel export functionality
3. Test responsive design on mobile devices
4. Validate error handling with invalid API responses
5. Test with large datasets for performance
6. Verify authentication requirements are met

## Future Enhancements
- Add chart visualization options
- Implement real-time data updates
- Add more export formats (CSV, XML)
- Include advanced analytics and insights
- Add bulk operations for target management
